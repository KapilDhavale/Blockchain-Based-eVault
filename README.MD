# 🛡️ Unified Blockchain-Based Legal Document Management (eVault)

> A decentralized, AI-integrated system for secure and transparent legal document storage, built using Ethereum, IPFS, and NLP-based summarization.

---

## 📚 Abstract

The legal industry demands robust, tamper-resistant, and accessible document storage solutions. This project presents a blockchain-based eVault that integrates Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS (via Pinata), MetaMask authentication, and NLP document summarization to deliver a scalable, decentralized legal document management system. It eliminates reliance on centralized servers, ensures document integrity, and enables efficient access control for legal professionals.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The architecture consists of the following modules:

- **Frontend**: React-based UI with MetaMask integration for login and transactions.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum smart contracts ensure immutable document metadata and role-based access control.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Documents are stored on IPFS using the Pinata API.
- **AI Backend**: NLP module summarizes uploaded legal documents using transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT).
- **Database**: A NoSQL store maintains metadata and links between IPFS hashes and smart contract records.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. 🔐 **Login via MetaMask**  
   Users authenticate securely without exposing private keys.

2. 📤 **Document Upload**  
   - Document is hashed.
   - Metadata (timestamp, uploader, type) is generated.
   - Hash and metadata are recorded on Ethereum via smart contracts.
   - File is uploaded to IPFS through Pinata.

3. 📑 **Summarization & Storage**  
   - NLP backend extracts and summarizes document.
   - Summary is stored with metadata and linked to the blockchain.

4. 🔎 **Access Control**  
   Role-based permissions are enforced by smart contracts:
   - `grantAccess(address user)`
   - `revokeAccess(address user)`

5. 📥 **Retrieval**  
   Authorized users retrieve IPFS content using the hash and view summaries for rapid understanding.
